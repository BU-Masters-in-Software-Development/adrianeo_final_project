For Grading purposes, I have generated a "MOCK_DATA.csv" file to make testing
my application quick and painless, their are also unit tests already
incorporated within each class and pre-defined and loaded with the
test_transactions.csv file as well...

Steps to run are as follows:

main.py
Transaction.py
FinanceManager.py

Ensure that you have MOCK_DATA.csv in the same directory you are running the
source code.

Last but not least...
